# Stock Market Analysis with VBA

This repository contains VBA scripts for analyzing stock market data in Microsoft Excel. The VBA script loops through each worksheet, calculates the quarterly change, percentage change, and total stock volume for each ticker symbol, and outputs the results to a summary table. Additionally, it applies conditional formatting to highlight positive and negative changes in the "Quarterly Change" and "Percent Change" columns.

## Files Included:

- **StockAnalysis.vba**: This is the main VBA script that performs the analysis on all worksheets in the Excel workbook.
- **SampleData.xlsx**: This Excel file contains sample stock market data for testing the script.

## Instructions:

1. Ensure that you have Microsoft Excel installed on your computer.
2. Download or clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Open the Excel file "SampleData.xlsx" containing the stock market data.
4. Enable macros in Excel if prompted.
5. Open the VBA editor in Excel (Alt + F11) and paste the contents of "StockAnalysis.vba" into a new module.
6. Close the VBA editor and run the `StockAnalysis` subroutine to execute the analysis.
7. View the results in each worksheet's summary table.
